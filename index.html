 <!--Very cool how easy it is to bring images into a webpage with emmet. I wish I would have known this for my ASP.NET project! src means source, and is the file path that the image is located in. You can either right click the image on the file explorer on the left to get the file path, or just simply type / and path to it using emmet if the picture is in the same folder as your 
 project(as it should be)-->
